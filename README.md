Javascript Based LEAP MOTION Mesh Manipulation

Will need to include:

	-three.js
	-leap.js
	-Stats.js (if you want stats)


Please let me know if you would like to work on this project, because right now it is extroidinarily simple, but the Leap has phenomenal potential when it comes to this sort of thing.

Controls right now: 

1 pointable shows you position
2 pointables will add a 'connector' to the field which will 'grab' verticies and pull them wherever you move your hands

remove 1 or both pointables in order to let go of that vertex

Please contact me with questions / comments / suggestions
