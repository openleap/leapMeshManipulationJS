Javascript Based LEAP MOTION Mesh Manipulation

Controls right now: 

1 pointable shows you position
2 pointables will add a 'connector' to the field which will 'grab' verticies and pull them wherever you move your hands

remove 1 or both pointables in order to let go of that vertex

Think of your Fingers as 'Scissors' which will create a connection when ther is a vertex that can be 'Snipped' when you quickly move your fingers together.
